This project evaluated the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) as a better signal for cryptocurrency trading than standard closing price data. The project involved using deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices, with one model using the FNG indicators to predict the closing price and another model using a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price. The project included preparing the data for training and testing, building and training custom LSTM RNNs, and evaluating the performance of each model.
